#GitHub History of Scala
This is a project that I completed in DataCamp. Focus areas of the project are data manipulation, data visualization, and importing and cleaning data. Has Scala's popularity decreased? The answer is no. Pull requests have remained about the same over the time frame of 2011 to 2018. Additionally, many members have contributed over time. A few members have stepped up to work on the project as much as possible by noticing their pull requests. Other questions to pursue in the future are:
<ol>
<li>What is the mean pull requests per year?</li>
<li>How many users pulled requests on a yearly basis?</li>
<li>Can a scatter plot show use more information on the pull requests of the outliers?</li>
</ol>
